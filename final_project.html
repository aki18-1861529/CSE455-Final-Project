        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Facial recognition is a technology that has been around for decades. During this time, the
            technology has matured, and saw many different applications in various fields, ranging from
            live camera filters to security. Despite the range of applications it has, facial recognition
            boils down to software that can detect a person's face in visual media, such as photos and videos.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, like with many other technologies, the way facial recognition is implemented varies
            between developers, and therefore can have some variation in terms of accuracy and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on this idea, we decided to implement a facial recognition software that builds on two different
            facial recognition techniques in order to compare their performance:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    The first technique uses a Facebook technology called DETR (DEtection TRansformer),
                    which is used to detect and recognize different subject models, which we modified for
                    recognizing faces.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The second technique uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and data from the Yale Face
                    Database to detect faces based on a generated "average" face.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h1>DETR</h1>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, DETR is a Facebook-developed technology that is used to recognize different
            objects in pictures. For the purposes of our project, we introduced data from WiderFaces to train it to
            recognize faces.

        <h1>PCA</h1>
        <p>
            For this approach, we generated a PCA model using the Yale Face Database to analyze multiple samples of human faces,
            and used greyscaled images of celebrities to generate an "average" face which was used for classification.
        </p>

    <section>
        <h1>Conclusions</h1>
        <p>
            Based on the data we collected, we found that DETR has better performance than PCA does. However, this performance
            comes with a tradeoff. DETR relies on a very large amount of data that takes a very long time and a lot of resources
            to properly train and run, and requires data to be tailored beforehand. On the other hand, PCA is much less demanding
            in terms of data and resources, and is more flexible with the data it is given, at the cost of less accuracy.
